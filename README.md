## **Project Goals**

The primary goal of this project is to display a clear introduction and professional background/ qualifications to potential employers.

## Employers Goals

The main target audience for this project is senior digital professionals who require individuals with specific software development skills.

## Goals:

* A clear easy site to read.
* Easy navigation of the site.
* A clear understanding of the individuals knowledge and current skillset.
* An easy way to contact.

This project will meet these needs because:

* The planning process considered an easy to read colour scheme to ensure readability. 
* The layout was carefully planned to ensure easy viewing. 
* The overall project is clear and professional allowing for easy reading and quick information. 
* The website ensures an easy and streamless way of contacting.


## Developer and Business goals 

- To create a clean and clear design to professionaly represent information. 
- A professionally presented first example of using HTML, CSS and bootstrap technologies. 
- a projec thr developer is excited to represent and have as part of thier portfolio.

## User stories

As a potential employer I want:

- The ability to see the skills first hand of the devloper. 
- To be able to easily navigate throughout the site. 
- To be able to easily contact the project developer (as this is the main goal for the project development)
- To be able to quickly understand the professional background of the developer. 

# Design Choices

The design of the portfolio is a clear and professional layout. The follwong design choices was made with this in mind. 

## Fonts 

- The primary font used for this project is **Roboto Mono**. I used this as it's a clear font with little chance of it causing readability issues. It also looks great with emphasis applied such as the bold text for the headings.

## Icons

- All icons were used for the intented meaning and purpose. The logos have universal understanding.

## Colours 

- The primary pastel blue colour was chosen as the main colour because it contrasts well with the green colours used for the other elements. It was chosen to give a calm and friendly appeal to the webpage, whilst also giving the site a professional and sophisticated impression.

- The secondary green colours were chosen as it contrasts well with the blue background. whislt also giving options to use in different shades, for example; witht he buttons in the header section. The hover element takes the button to a darker green to highlight this action. Whilst it doesn't affect the readability of the text. This colour also allowewd for consistency across the project.

## Styling

- The text area's in the contact form were given curved edges to display a friendly and approachable way of contacting. Whilst not taking away from the professional look of the site. However the buttons in the header section were given sharp corners to show different abilities with styling, but not take away from the general consistency of the page with sharp and grid display layout. 

## Backgrounds

- The background was chosen to not include any images due to, wanting to make the website clear and simple to read. I think with adding background images to the majority of this site would distract the user from the important context. 

- The background colour was chosen to be a pastel blue becuase, it aligns well with the rest of the colour scheme which adss to the general professional look of the project.

## Header Image

- The header image was used to capture attention and to align with giving quick information from the start. The image clearly represents coding, programming and software development. Which aligns with the main goal of the website. To capture attention and disaply clear information.

## Video 

- The video on the form.html page was chosen to continue the ongoing theme of the context. Ensuring that the user understands that this is a representation of a software developer. 

- It was also chosen to display further skills of the developer. Aligning with the developer goals. 

# Wireframes

These wireframes were created using Figma during the scope plane aspect of the planning process.
